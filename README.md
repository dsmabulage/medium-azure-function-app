# Deploying Azure Blob Trigger Functions (.NET) via GitHub Actions  

This repository demonstrates deploying an Azure Function App with a **.NET Blob Trigger** using **Zip Push deployment** via GitHub Actions. The deployment process is automated using a **Service Principal** for authentication, ensuring a secure and efficient CI/CD pipeline.  

### Deployment Steps:  
1. **Provision Azure Resources** â€“ Create an Azure Function App, Storage Account, and Application Insights.  
2. **Set Up Authentication** â€“ Register a Service Principal and assign it the required roles.  
3. **Create and Configure the Function App** â€“ Develop the Blob Trigger Function and configure the required storage settings.  
4. **Set Up GitHub Actions** â€“ Configure secrets, repository settings, and add the deployment workflow (`.github/workflows/azure-functions-app-dotnet.yml`).  
5. **Automated Deployment** â€“ Pushing to the `main` branch triggers the GitHub Action, building, packaging, and deploying the function to Azure.  
6. **Testing** â€“ Upload a file to the storage container to trigger the function and verify the logs.
